# Task Scheduler System (Java)

## Overview
This project implements a simple priority-based task scheduler in Java.

## Description
Tasks are executed based on priority using Java PriorityQueue. Higher priority tasks are executed before lower priority tasks.

## Concepts Used
- PriorityQueue
- Comparable interface
- Object-Oriented Programming

## How to Run
javac Main.java
java Main


## Sample Output
Executing tasks:
Task ID: 3, Name: System Update, Priority: 3
Task ID: 1, Name: Database Backup, Priority: 2
Task ID: 2, Name: Email Notifications, Priority: 1


## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand how priority-based scheduling works in Java.
